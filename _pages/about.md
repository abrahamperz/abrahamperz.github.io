I am a bachelor's student in <b>Mechatronics Engineering</b> at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico. My interests focus on <b>researching</b> and <b>programming</b> complex systems like <b>robotics</b>, as well as <b>control systems</b> and <b>computer vision</b>. Regarding myself, I am interested in developing new algorithms, systems, and theories to <b>help empower people and society</b>. All of this using the tools provided by the use of computing, hardware, and robotics science.
