<p style='text-align: justify;'>


I am a bachelor's student in Mechatronics Engineering at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico. My interests focus on Researching and Programming complex systems like Robotics, as well as Control Systems and Computer Vision. Regarding myself, I am interested in developing new algorithms, systems, and theories to help empower people and society. All of this using the tools provided by the use of Computing, Hardware, and Robotics sciences.

During my time at ITESM, I had the pleasure to found and be the president of the International Robotics team Robotec of ITESM. Robotec is an inter-disciplinary robotics team participating in National and International competitions like the Torneo Mexicano de Robotica, RoboRave International. Moreover, I was part of the board of directors of the Students Society of Mechatronics SAIMT and IEEE group at ITESM. I did a research internship at HP Labs, a Software/Hardware internship at Intel. Currently I am doing a research internship at Harvard Medical School.
