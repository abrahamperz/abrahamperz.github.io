I am a Bachelor <b>Mechatronics Engineering</b> student at Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey<b> ITESM</b>.
I am a person interested in <b>Research</b> and <b>Programming</b> complex systems like <b>Robotics</b>, integrating areas such as Control Systems and Computer Vision. More specific, I am interested in developing algorithms using <b>Data structures</b> and <b> Machine Learning </b> in the interplay beetween <b>Deep Learning</b> and <b>Control Engineering</b>
<br><br>

During my time at <b>ITESM</b>, I had the pleasure to <b>Founded</b> and be the <b>President</b>  of the International representative <b>Robotics team</b> <i>Robotec</i> of my University in January 2018. We are an inter-disciplinary robotics team partipating in <b>National and International</b> competitions like Torneo Mexicano de Robotica, RoboRave International.
